**I built a lie detector for the internet.** 🕵️‍♂️

LLMs are great at being creative, but terrible at being factual. They hallucinate. They make things up.

So I built **Veritas AI** to fix that.

It uses **Google Gemini** with **Search Grounding** to cross-reference every generated response against live web results. It doesn't just guess—it cites its sources.

**The Tech Stack:**
⚡ **Frontend**: React 19 + TypeScript (Serverless architecture)
🧠 **AI**: Gemini 2.5 Flash
🔍 **Grounding**: Google Search Tool
🎨 **UI**: Tailwind CSS

I wrote a full engineering deep dive on the architecture, prompt strategies, and how to handle real-time grounding data.
