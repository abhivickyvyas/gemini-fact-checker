Misinformation travels faster than the truth. I wanted to see if AI could keep up. 🕵️‍♂️

I spent the weekend building **Veritas AI**—a real-time fact-checking application. It doesn't just ask an LLM for an opinion; it uses **Google Search Grounding** to perform live research and verify claims against active web sources.

🚀 **The Engineering Challenge:**
Standard LLMs hallucinate. To make them reliable fact-checkers, you have to move from "Generative" to "Grounded."

I wrote a deep-dive article on how I architected this using a Serverless Client-Side model with React and Gemini 2.5.

**Inside the article (link below 👇):**
✅ **High-Level Architecture**: Why I skipped the backend for this demo.
✅ **Prompt Engineering**: How to force deterministic "Verdicts" from a probabilistic model.
✅ **Search Grounding**: How the code actually handles live citations.

It's a look at how frontend engineers can build "Trustworthy AI" interfaces.
