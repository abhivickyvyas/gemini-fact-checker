I built a tool to fight misinformation in real-time, and you can see how it's done.

Fighting the spread of false information is a huge challenge. I wanted to see if I could build a simple, powerful web app to help.

Introducing **Veritas AI**—an app that uses the Google Gemini API to instantly analyze any statement, provide a verdict (True, False, or Mixed), and back it up with a detailed explanation and verifiable sources from Google Search.

**How it works:**
The magic is in the Gemini API's `googleSearch` grounding tool. With a single line of configuration, the AI's response is grounded in up-to-the-minute web data, ensuring the facts are current and sourced.

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Instant, AI-powered fact-checking.
- 🔗 Verifiable sources for every claim.
- 🗂️ A persistent history sidebar to track your checks.
- 📱 A fully responsive design for desktop and mobile.

This project was a fantastic exercise in leveraging generative AI for a practical, impactful purpose. The developer experience with the `@google/genai` SDK and the power of grounding made it possible to build a robust tool quickly.
