# Veritas AI

Veritas AI is an application that uses the Gemini API with Google Search grounding to verify the factual accuracy of statements in real-time, providing a clear verdict, a detailed explanation, and verifiable source links.

## Features

-   **Real-Time Analysis**: Get instant factual analysis of any statement or claim.
-   **Clear Verdicts**: Each check returns a clear, color-coded verdict: **True**, **False**, or **Mixed/Nuanced**.
-   **Detailed Explanations**: Understand the reasoning behind the verdict with a concise explanation generated by Gemini.
-   **Sourced Information**: All claims are backed by a list of sources from Google Search, promoting transparency and further reading.
-   **Persistent History**: Your past fact-checks are automatically saved and displayed in a convenient sidebar for easy access.
-   **Shareable Results**: Share or download the result card as an image.
-   **Responsive & Modern UI**: A clean, two-column layout that works beautifully on both desktop and mobile devices, built with React and Tailwind CSS.

## Tech Stack

-   **Frontend**: React, TypeScript
-   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
-   **AI Model**: Google Gemini (`gemini-2.5-flash`)
-   **Core Feature**: Gemini API with Google Search Grounding

## Prerequisites

-   A modern web browser.
-   A Google Gemini API key.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable)**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd veritas-ai
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**
    This project uses a CDN-based import map for React and `@google/genai`, so no `npm install` is required for those packages. If you add other dependencies, you'll need a package manager like `npm` or `yarn`.

3.  **Set up Environment Variables**
    The application requires a Google Gemini API key. In a real-world local setup, you would create a `.env` file in the project root:
    ```
    API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY
    ```
    When running in a supported environment (like Google's Project IDX), this key is typically configured for you.

4.  **Run the application**
    Open the `index.html` file in your browser using a local web server (like the Live Server extension in VS Code).

## How It Works

The user enters a claim into the textarea. When the "Check" button is clicked, the `geminiService` sends the claim to the Gemini API. The prompt is engineered to ask the model to first return a verdict (`TRUE`, `FALSE`, or `MIXED`) and then provide an explanation. Crucially, the API call enables the `googleSearch` tool, which grounds the model's response in real-time information from the web. The response text and the grounding metadata (source links) are then parsed and displayed in the `ResultCard` component. New results are saved to the browser's local storage and displayed in the history sidebar.
